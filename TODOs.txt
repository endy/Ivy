TODOs:

-allow for different transition endpoints by msg type

-World collisions
-collision between entities

-Room transition on collsion with door region?

-Weapon projectiles at correct offset
-projectiles collision with objects

-Camera interpolation
-Add AnimGraph visualization

Trivialities:

Rename AnimatedSprite to Animation (it could handle many animations)


Niceties:

Unserialization of game elements from XML to game objects
Cut-scene support
Debug Console (possibly with input feature)
XML State Loading + Sprite Management
